# Cinnamon Rolls 
## Ingredients:

### For the dough:

+ 500g all-purpose flour
+ 7g (1 packet) instant yeast
+ 250ml warm milk
+ 75g granulated sugar
+ 75g unsalted butter, melted
+ 1 teaspoon salt
+ 1 large egg

### For the filling:

+ 75g unsalted butter, softened
+ 100g brown sugar
+ 2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

### For the glaze:

+ 100g powdered sugar
+ 2-3 tablespoons milk
+ 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)

### Instructions:

Prepare the Dough:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and instant yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy.
Add the melted butter, sugar, salt, and egg to the yeast mixture. Stir until well combined.
Gradually add the flour to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms.
Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic.
Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.
Prepare the Filling:
In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon until well combined.

### Assemble the Rolls:
Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick.
Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the dough.
Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log.
Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 12 equal-sized rolls.

### Bake the Rolls:
Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll.
Cover the dish with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes.
Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F).
Once risen, bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

### Make the Glaze:
In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed.
Serve:
Once the rolls are baked, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top.
Serve warm and enjoy your homemade Zimtschnecken!
