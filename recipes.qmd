##### Prepare the Dough:

In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm milk and instant yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until foamy. Add the melted butter, sugar, salt, and egg to the yeast mixture. Stir until well combined. Gradually add the flour to the mixture, stirring until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Prepare the Filling: In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, brown sugar, and ground cinnamon until well combined.

##### Assemble the Rolls:

Once the dough has risen, punch it down and roll it out on a floured surface into a large rectangle, about 1/4 inch thick. Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the dough. Starting from one long edge, tightly roll up the dough into a log. Use a sharp knife to cut the log into 12 equal-sized rolls.

##### Bake the Rolls:

Place the rolls in a greased baking dish, leaving a little space between each roll. Cover the dish with a clean kitchen towel and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Once risen, bake the rolls in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.

##### Make the Glaze:

In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Adjust the consistency by adding more milk if needed. Serve: Once the rolls are baked, let them cool for a few minutes before drizzling the glaze over the top. Serve warm and enjoy your homemade Zimtschnecken!

## Tiramisu

![](images/Bildschirmfoto%202024-05-28%20um%2010.23.00.png)

### Ingredients:

500 g (17.6 oz) Mascarpone cheese 6 eggs (separated into yolks and whites) 200 g (7 oz) sugar 1 pinch of salt 300 g (10.6 oz) ladyfingers (savoiardi biscuits) 300 ml (10 fl oz) strong coffee (cooled) 4 tablespoons Amaretto or Marsala (optional) Cocoa powder for dusting Dark chocolate shavings (optional)

### Instructions:

#### Preparation:

Brew the strong coffee and let it cool. Mix the coffee with the Amaretto or Marsala, if using. Egg mixture:

Separate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks with 100 g (3.5 oz) of sugar until the mixture is pale and creamy. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt until stiff peaks form. Gradually add the remaining 100 g (3.5 oz) of sugar and continue beating until the mixture is glossy and firm. Mascarpone mixture:

Stir the Mascarpone until smooth, then gently fold it into the egg yolk-sugar mixture. Carefully fold in the egg whites until you have a smooth and airy mixture. Layering:

Briefly dip the ladyfingers into the coffee and place a layer in a baking dish or individual dessert glasses. Spread a layer of the Mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat the process until all the ingredients are used up, finishing with a layer of Mascarpone mixture. Chilling:

Cover the Tiramisu and let it chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld. Serving:

Before serving, generously dust the Tiramisu with cocoa powder and sprinkle with dark chocolate shavings, if desired.


Enjoy your delicious Tiramisu!
